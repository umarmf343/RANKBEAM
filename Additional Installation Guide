It looks like you're working with a project that involves building a Windows application using Go and the Fyne UI toolkit. The guides you provided are detailed instructions, but I'll break them down into easier-to-follow steps for you:

Quick Steps to Set Up and Build the Application for Windows

1. Update the README.md File:

Go to the README.md file in the Umar-kdp-product-api project.

Find the "Quick start" section and replace the existing code with the following snippet:


# run the UI locally on Windows
$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"
go run ./cmd/app

# build a Windows executable from Windows
$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"
go build -o "rankbeam.exe" ./cmd/app

# cross-compile the Windows executable from Linux/macOS
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o "rankbeam.exe" ./cmd/app


2. Create the docs/BUILD_WINDOWS.md File:

Create or overwrite a file named BUILD_WINDOWS.md in the docs folder of your project with the following content:


# Building RankBeam for Windows

## 1. Prerequisites (Windows)

- Install **Go 1.21** or newer for Windows.
- Install **MSYS2** and run:
  ```powershell
  pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-pkg-config

Install Fyne CLI by running:

go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest

Add %GOPATH%\bin (or %USERPROFILE%\go\bin) to your PATH.

Install Inno Setup 6 for creating the installer.

Optionally, install Git for Windows for easy updates.


2. Fetch the Go dependencies

go mod download

3. Run the application locally (Windows)

Set the CGO_ENABLED environment variable and run the app:

$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"
go run ./cmd/app

4. Build a Windows 64-bit executable

Run the following command:

$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"
fyne package `
  -os windows `
  -icon assets/app.png `
  -sourceDir cmd/app `
  -name "RankBeam" `
  -appID com.rankbeam.app

Alternatively, you can build directly using Go:

$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"
go build -o "rankbeam.exe" ./cmd/app

5. Cross-compile from Linux (Optional)

On Linux, install MinGW and use the following commands:


CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  fyne package -os windows -icon assets/app.png -sourceDir cmd/app \
  -name "RankBeam" -appID com.rankbeam.app

6. Package with Inno Setup

Use Inno Setup to package the application:

Open installer/rankbeam.iss with Inno Setup and follow the instructions to build the installer.


7. Verify the build

Run the .exe file on a Windows machine and ensure that the application works.


8. Ship it

Bundle the installer and product description for release.





3. Create the installer/rankbeam.iss File:

Create or overwrite the rankbeam.iss file in the installer folder with this content:


; RankBeam Installer
; Generated for building a Windows setup package using Inno Setup

[Setup]
AppName=RankBeam
AppVersion=1.0.0
AppPublisher=Amazon Intelligence Labs
DefaultDirName={pf64}\RankBeam
DefaultGroupName=RankBeam
DisableProgramGroupPage=yes
UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\rankbeam.exe
OutputDir=.
OutputBaseFilename=rankbeam-setup
Compression=lzma
SolidCompression=yes

[Files]

Source: "..\README.md"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion

[Icons]
Name: "{group}\RankBeam"; Filename: "{app}\rankbeam.exe"
Name: "{commondesktop}\RankBeam"; Filename: "{app}\rankbeam.exe"; Tasks: desktopicon

[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "Create a &desktop shortcut"; GroupDescription: "Additional icons:"; Flags: unchecked

[Run]
Filename: "{app}\rankbeam.exe"; Description: "Launch RankBeam"; Flags: nowait postinstall skipifsilent




---

Simplified Flow:

1. Set up dependencies: Install Go, Fyne CLI, MSYS2, and Inno Setup.


2. Download Go dependencies: Run go mod download to get all dependencies.


3. Run the app locally: Use go run ./cmd/app to start the app in PowerShell.


4. Build Windows executable: Use go build to create the .exe file or use Fyne to package the app.


5. (Optional) Cross-compile from Linux: If needed, you can build the Windows executable from Linux.


6. Package with Inno Setup: Use Inno Setup to create an installer for the application.


7. Test: Run the built .exe on Windows to ensure everything works.



I hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you need more clarification.
